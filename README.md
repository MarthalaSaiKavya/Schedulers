# Scheduling Algorithms Implementation


Implementation of two scheduling algorithms in with starvation prevention mechanisms.

## Features

- **Two Scheduling Policies**:
  - **Aging-Based Scheduler** (Dynamic priority escalation)
  - **Linux-like Scheduler** (Epoch-based quantum allocation)

- **Key Components**:
  - Dynamic priority adjustment system
  - Quantum carry-forward implementation
  - NULL process handling strategies
  - Context switching optimizations
